# Vonage CPaaS Power

Welcome to the Vonage Kiro Power. This Power gives you access to the Vonage Communications Platform APIs through guided workflows and inline documentation.

## Onboarding

Before running any workflow, verify that the required credentials are available.

### Step 1: Check account-level credentials

Call `get-balance` using the `vonage-api` MCP server.

- If the call **succeeds**, credentials are configured correctly. Proceed to the requested workflow.
- If the call **fails** with an authentication error (401) or returns an empty/zero result that looks unexpected, the credentials are missing or wrong. Stop immediately and follow the recovery steps below.

**CRITICAL**: Do not attempt any other workflow steps until credentials are confirmed working. Proceeding without valid credentials will cause all subsequent API calls to fail.

### Step 2: Recovery — credentials not configured

If `get-balance` failed, display this message to the user exactly:

> **Your Vonage credentials are not configured yet.** To fix this, add the following to a `.env` file in your project root (or export them in your shell before launching Kiro):
>
> ```
> VONAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
> VONAGE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
> ```
>
> You can find both values at [https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings).
>
> Once set, **restart Kiro** so it picks up the new environment variables, then try again.

Do not continue until the user confirms they have set the variables and restarted Kiro. Then re-run `get-balance` to confirm before proceeding.

## Quick Start

Run the **Get Started** workflow to go from zero to a working Vonage application in minutes:

> **"Start the Vonage get-started workflow"** or **"Help me set up Vonage"**

The workflow will:
1. Validate your API credentials
2. Create a Vonage Application with your chosen capabilities
3. Search for and purchase a phone number
4. Link the number to your application
5. Point you to code examples in your preferred language
