## What Is This?

This Power connects [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) to the Vonage CPaaS platform via two MCP servers:

| Server | Description |
|---|---|
| **`vonage-api`** | Live API bindings for account management, phone numbers, applications, and activity reports |
| **`vonage-docs`** | Vonage developer documentation, SDK references, and code examples |

Combined with steering files that encode best-practice workflows, Kiro can guide you through tasks like setting up a new Vonage application, purchasing a phone number, and pulling activity reports — all through natural conversation.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) installed and running
- A [Vonage API account](https://ui.idp.vonage.com/ui/auth/registration) (free to create)
- Your Vonage API Key and Secret from the [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings)

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-kiro-power.git
   ```

2. Set your Vonage credentials as environment variables **before launching Kiro**. The quickest way is a `.env` file in your project root:

   ```bash
   VONAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VONAGE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
   ```

   Find both values at [Vonage Dashboard → API Settings](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings). See [Configuration](#configuration) for the full list of variables.

3. Open the directory in Kiro — the Power is detected automatically from `POWER.md`. Kiro reads your environment variables and passes them to the MCP server on startup.

> **Credentials not set?** When you trigger a workflow, the Power will detect missing credentials and walk you through the setup before proceeding.

## Workflows

### Get Started

Goes from credentials to a fully configured Vonage Application with a linked phone number.

**Trigger phrases:** `"Set up Vonage"`, `"Help me get started with Vonage"`, `"Create a Vonage app"`, `"Buy a number"`

**Steps:**
1. Validates your API credentials against the live API
2. Creates a Vonage Application with your chosen capabilities (Messages, Voice, or both)
3. Searches for available phone numbers in your chosen country
4. Purchases and links the number to your application
5. Outputs all environment variables you need to continue building

---

### Reports & Monitoring

Pulls activity records, visualizes data, and checks account balance.

**Trigger phrases:** `"Show my reports"`, `"Check message delivery"`, `"Monitor usage"`, `"Check my balance"`

**Steps:**
1. Retrieves message and call records for a date range you specify (up to 30 days)
2. Filters by channel, destination number, status, or direction
3. Generates charts to visualize message volume, delivery rates, and channel distribution
4. Reports your current account balance with optional low-balance warnings
